            <p>The British Government is the central government of the United Kingdom, which
                consists of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The government is a
                parliamentary democracy, with Queen Elizabeth II serving as the head of state but
                holding limited powers due
                to the constitutional monarchy. In practice, the Prime Minister, currently Boris
                Johnson, exercises most executive power.</p>

        <text type="text3">
            <p>The British Government is divided into several branches, including the Executive,
                Legislative, and Judicial branches.</p>

            <p>Executive branch</p>
        </text>
        <text type="text4">
            <p>The Executive branch is led by the Prime Minister and includes various cabinet-level
                ministers responsible for different areas of governance, such
                as finance, education, health, and defense.</p>

            <p>Legislative branch</p>
        </text>
        <text type="text4">
            <p>The Legislative branch is the Parliament, which consists of the House of Commons and
                the House of Lords. Members of Parliament are elected by the people through a
                first-past-the-post system, while members of the House of
                Lords are appointed by the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister.</p>

            <p>Judicial branch</p>
        </text>
        <text type="text4">
            <p>The Judicial branch is headed by the Supreme Court, which was established in 2009 to
                replace the House of Lords as the highest court in the land. The Supreme Court has
                the power to interpret the law and ensure that it is consistent with the European
                Convention on
                Human Rights and other relevant international agreements.</p>
